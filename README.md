The complete repository for CS691: Project 1 & CS 692: Research Project

## Project Application: Online Art Gallery - _Revolution Art_

This repository will potentially change over the lifetime of the production of _Revolution Art_.

## Course Descriptions:

This is Part 1 of a two-semester Capstone course that emphasizes software engineering design through the use of abstraction, creativity, algorithmic problem-solving, programming, and computational thinking skills as well as solicits studentsâ€™ knowledge and understanding of and ability to integrate learning from core and other courses into a culminating computer science experience wherein they conceive of and develop a practical software solution (business application) to a real problem of interest to a customer base.

Students enrolled in Computer Science Project II will finish their project begun in Computer Science Project I and write a major report. When the report has been completed, each student will be expected to give an oral presentation and project demonstration before the committee. The project advisor will assign a grade for the work in consultation with the committee. This grade will also be assigned to Computer Science Project I.
