## Project Application: Online Art Gallery - _Revolution Art_

This repository will potentially change over the lifetime (September 2022 - May 2023) of the production of _Revolution Art_.

## Requirements to Access Revolution Art Locally
<details>
 <summary>Run Locally</summary>
 
- Ensure you have the latest version of Node on your local machine. We recommend using Node Version Manager (NVM) to install and manage multiple Node versions.
  - To run the client locally, from the client directory, run ```npm start```. A server should start on ```localhost:3000/```
</details>

<details>
 <summary>Developing Locally</summary>
 
- Clone this repo to your local machine
- Before starting a new feature, run ```git pull``` to get the most up to date files.
- Make code changes to your local branch.
- To commit your changes locally, run ```git add .```, then ```git commit -m '[message describing commit]'```.

 <summary>For Testing Purposes</summary>
 
- Go to the "Code" drop down button: 

![code](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70993217/228628715-aa6ffaf9-f21d-40bf-ab9d-651d4b640b67.png)
  - Select "Download ZIP".
- Once that is finished downloading (fairly quick), open up the folder "SourceCode" in VS Code:

  - Your file hierarchy should look like:

<!-- 
- Open the "server" folder and open the ```index.js``` file.
  - Scroll down to line 30 and comment it out (```CMD``` + ```/``` on Macs)
  - Now, uncomment line 31 and save the file. -->
- Open the terminal in VS Code.
  - Type the following commands:
    - ```cd client```
    - ```npm start```
      -  Please reach out to Zo, Shanshan or Kishore for the updated ```.env``` file for the ```server``` folder. 
      - If there is an error here, try typing ```npm install```, if a different error occurs, type ```npm install --force```. That should work, so now you can type ```npm start```.
  - Your default browser should open up a tab with ```localhost:3000``` in it (if you have an older computer, it may take a little time).
    - However if it takes more than 3min, in the terminal type ```control``` + ```c``` (on Macs) to stop the ```localhost``` from running and retype ```npm start```. It should work now.
- Now that you have that up and running, go back to VS Code and open a *second* terminal window (**DO NOT** close the first one), and in it type the following commands:
  - ```cd server```
  - ```npm install```
  - ```npm start```
- When that is finished, go back to your default browser and refresh your ```localhost```.

If you have any questions or errors, please reach out to Zo or Kishore.

## Course Descriptions:

CS691 is Part 1 of a two-semester Capstone course that emphasizes software engineering design through the use of abstraction, creativity, algorithmic problem-solving, programming, and computational thinking skills as well as solicits studentsâ€™ knowledge and understanding of and ability to integrate learning from core and other courses into a culminating computer science experience wherein they conceive of and develop a practical software solution (business application) to a real problem of interest to a customer base.

In CS692, students<!--enrolled in Computer Science Project II --> will finish their project begun in Computer Science Project I and write a major report. When the report has been completed, each student will be expected to give an oral presentation and project demonstration before the committee. The project advisor will assign a grade for the work in consultation with the committee. This grade will also be assigned to Computer Science Project I.
